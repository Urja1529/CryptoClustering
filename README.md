# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, Iâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Data set Used

crypto_market_data.csv market data of different cryptocurrencies during different time periods

# Prepare data

In order to prepare data I have used Standard scaling method and used elbow-method to find optimal number of cluster for  K-Means model

# Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.
